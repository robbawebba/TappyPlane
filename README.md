TappyPlane
==========

Tappy Plane is a simple "helicopter"-type game made in a Computer Science class using Racket at the University of Delaware.

"tappy-plane.rkt" is the main program file. To run any of these files, you must use a Racket Programming Environment, such as 
Dr.Racket. One is available to download at http://racket-lang.org/.

*** "collision.rkt" and "vec.rkt" must be saved in the same location in order for "tappy-plane.rkt" to work. ***
*** If you are using the student languages of Dr.Racket, make sure you have the student language set to "Advanced student" ***
